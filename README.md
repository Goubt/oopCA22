# Description of the assignment
Our assignment consists of a rotating menu. This was done as a challenge, seeing if we could utilise the camera to move around within the 3d space.
The user "stands" in the centre of the menu, able to turn the view point between the three visualations while it changes the song to match the visualisation.

## Finn

# Instructions
Each menu option has its own controls that can manipulate features in each visualations.

## The Global Controls
- "Right arrow" rotates the menu one slot to the right.
- "Left arrow" rotates the menu one slow to the left.
- "Space bar" to pause / play the music.
- "B" to turn on/off background beat brightness.

## Poison controls
- Mouse controls direction the poison bubbles move in.
- "L" to lock/unlock camera.
With camera locked you can now
- "K" to move back from the visual.
- "I" to move in towards the visual.

## Dare controls
- "X"
- "C"
- "H"
- "Up Arrow"
- "Down Arrow"

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
